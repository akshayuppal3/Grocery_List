Created a python script that is capable of scanning a reciept and return only relevant product item from the list. This script uses microst vision API and uses optical character recongnition to scan the prodcuct items. It filtes the noise in two stages, it fisrt checks the corpus for the relevant items and finally removes the quantity items from it and creates a list from it.
